# Life-Expectancy-Insights-Challenge-2

## Overview
Welcome to the Life Expectancy Insights competition! Your task is to predict the life expectancy of individuals based on various health, demographic, and socio-economic factors. This challenge provides an opportunity to explore real-world datasets and apply your data science and machine learning skills to uncover patterns that influence life expectancy.

## Goal
The goal of this competition is to build a model capable of accurately predicting life expectancy given a set of features. Participants will be evaluated based on the accuracy of their predictions, encouraging innovative solutions and creative feature engineering.

## Description
Understanding life expectancy is a critical step in addressing global health and socio-economic challenges. By analyzing patterns and relationships in data, we can gain insights that inform policy, healthcare strategies, and social initiatives. This competition invites you to dive into this impactful domain by predicting life expectancy based on a diverse dataset.

## What is Life Expectancy?
Life expectancy refers to the average number of years a person is expected to live based on current mortality rates. It is influenced by a wide range of factors, including:

Health conditions: such as immunization coverage, prevalence of diseases, and access to healthcare.
Demographic features: including age, gender, and population metrics.
Socio-economic conditions: such as education levels, income, and living standards.
Accurately predicting life expectancy helps governments, organizations, and researchers identify areas of intervention and allocate resources effectively.

## Evaluation
Submissions for this competition will be evaluated based on the R² (Coefficient of Determination). This metric assesses how well your model's predictions align with the actual values. An R² value closer to 1 indicates a better fit, meaning your model explains most of the variance in the data.

## Submission File
Your submission file should contain predictions for the Life expectancy column in the test set. The file must include a header and follow this format:

ID,Life expectancy
1,73.7
2,75.9
3,74.2
4,76.8
5,51.9
etc.

File Specifications:
ID: Corresponds to the ID or row index from the test set, starting from 1.
Life expectancy: Your model's predicted value for life expectancy.
Make sure your file is a valid CSV and adheres to the format above. Any deviation from this format may result in submission errors.

Good luck, and may your predictions bring valuable insights!
